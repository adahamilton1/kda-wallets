## Objective

To create a simple, minimal common interface across all kadena wallets for easy dapp integration.

## Usage

- `@kcf/kda-wallet-base` contains the base `KdaWallet` abstract base class.
- All individual wallet packages `@kcf/kda-wallet-<wallet-name>` implement this class
- Dapps can now use the common `KdaWallet` type and its interfaces for common functionality such as signing transactions.

See `example/` folder for a minimal dapp using this library.

## FAQ

### Many wallets do not implement quicksign. Why is `quickSignCmds()` part of the base class if it's not available most of the time?

While quicksign is not implemented in many wallets yet ðŸ˜”, it seems like most wallets do intend to support it at some point in the future, which is why we decided to include it as part of the base class instead of splitting that out into its own interface. To see which wallets do not implement quicksign, please check the individual wallet packages' README.

### How did you get around each wallet having its own quirks in initialization?

We didn't ðŸ˜±. This is why the args passed to `KdaWallet.connect()` is different for each wallet as each wallet requires a different set of data for initialization. To see the type of initialization data required for each wallet, please check the individual wallet packages' README or the example app.

### Is this library typescript compatible?

The library is written in js with jsdoc typedefs and distributed directly as src. This should mean that you will get the type information when using it in typescript projects as well.
